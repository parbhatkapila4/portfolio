        Right now, Iâ€™m building AI-powered collaboration systems that turn meetings into living knowledge. Real-time agents, searchable transcripts, and post-call intelligence are wired into full-stack workflows with auth, payments, and background jobs. My focus is simple: ship fast, own the stack, and deliver systems that cut hours of work into seconds and scale reliably as teams grow.`}
